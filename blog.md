# data science: the not sexy parts

Sam and I work at GAO and lots of people complain about there not being a searchable database of the full text of reports. For games like 'sneak the obscure word past quality assurance' and more sophisticated questions like 'what methodologies have we deployed in previous work', or 'what does the citation graph of GAO reports look like?', a database of searchable text is the first step. So we decided to hack one together using the publicly available data.
